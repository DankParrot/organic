.orgASM
=======

.orgASM is an assembler for the DCPU-16 architecture.  It is a work-in-progress.

Planned Features
----------------

* Support for common directives (include, define, **org** etc)
* Relative addressing
* Macro support
* Listing output

Basically, everything you'd expect in a professional-grade assembler.

The goal of .orgASM is to be able to successfully assemble [this](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=W3WTDC09) file.
